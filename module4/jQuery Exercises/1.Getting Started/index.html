        </h1>
        <p>
            This exercise is about getting up and running.  The point is to establish that jquery is installed and available for use.  To that end, follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Download jQuery and copy it into this exercise's folder.</li>
            <li>Add the script tag into this page that points to the local jQuery file.</li>
            <li>In the 'script.js' file, add code to either log a 'Hello, World!' message to the log in the Developer Tools, or to popup that message in an alert window.</li>
            <li>Once you know javascript is working, output the jQuery object using either the log or alert methods.</li>
        </ul>
